Guidelines for contributing: 
(1) Write your post below using Markdown (as per https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ ) or just plain text
(2) Add the appropriate label (e.g. 'idea' or 'lightning talk', or both for idea pitches) to your post - use 'help wanted' as needed
(3) Don't worry about these introductory lines - you can leave or delete them, as they won't display anyway (you can check this via Preview)
