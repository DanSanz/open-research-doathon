# Background
[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) is an annual celebration of open data. In 2017, it takes place on March 4, and on that occasion, a two-day do-a-thon all around research data will be organized [in London](https://www.nwspk.com/) and online on March 4-5.

# Specifics
Description

We invite you, whether you’re in London or afar, to a weekend of learning, making, and doing to advance Open Research Data. The event is hosted by SPARC and the NIH as part of an international celebration for Open Data Day.

At its heart, Open Research Data is about making it easy for you and others to see, use and share data (to find out more, read this). This simple idea is powering some of the largest breakthroughs of our time and our event aims to celebrate and accelerate the power of Open Research Data.

We invite you, whether new or old to Open Research Data, scholar or citizen, in London or across the globe, to join us for this weekend to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!) in the name of Open Research Data.

In London, we’ll provide fast wifi, power (both for your laptops and your bodies) and a program that will spark ideas and collaborations for the weekend.

If you can’t make it to London, join us online from wherever you are. We’ll be documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event for remote participants. As a remote participant, expect to be able to pitch and discuss your ideas for the weekend with all attendees!

# Program

Each day will run 9am - 6pm. We’ll provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks (including coffee, of course) with informal dinner & drinks each evening. The program is designed to be lightweight and flexible to allow the maximum time for doing.

10-12 am: Introductions & opening / pitches

12-1 pm: Lunch

1-6pm: Working with occasional lightning talks

# Ideas for the Weekend

We're organizing ideas & more details on the program here. It’s up for you to decide how you spend the weekend, but if you’re short on ideas, here are some of ours:
* Trying to find / reuse an open data set
* Building engaging (and open) visualizations of open research data
* Adding some field-specific examples to Data Carpentry lessons
* Building a software library (Python module/ R package/ Ruby gem etc.) to facilitate access to and processing of open data from specific sources
* Building a set of Wikidata SPARQL queries for a specific field
* Harvesting data from the supplementary files of scholarly publications
* Participating in research-related activities that others are planning for Open Data Day
* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Adding a “research data” section to the Open Data Handbook
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with open research data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing data-centric grant proposals
* Make your own data FAIR
* Test out reproducible computational tools such as Binder, R-Shiny, CodeOcean [we can supply a list of resources]
* Prototype a tool to leverage the open datasets in eLife or in repositories (Zenodo, Dataverse, etc)
* Prototype a tool to make it easy for researchers to share/discover/consume comprehensive, open and FAIR data
* Devise a mechanism to incentivise deposition, review and reuse of datasets
