# Open Research do-a-thon
[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) is an annual celebration of open data. In 2017, it takes place on March 4, and on that occasion, a two-day do-a-thon all around research data will be organized [in London](https://www.nwspk.com/) and online on March 4-5.

To register for the event, please go to its [EventBrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/open-research-data-do-a-thon-in-london-virtual-tickets-31417371203).

We will update this repo on a regular basis until and during the event and possibly thereafter.
