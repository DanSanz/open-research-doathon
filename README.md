# Background

[Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) is an annual celebration of open data. In 2017, it takes place on March 4, and on that occasion, a two-day do-a-thon all around research data will be organized [in London](https://www.nwspk.com/) and online on March 4-5. This repo helps coordinate activities around that, and we will update it on a regular basis until and during the event and perhaps thereafter.

# Specifics

We invite you, whether you're in London or afar, to a weekend of learning, making, and doing to advance Open Research Data. The event is hosted by [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/) and the [NIH](https://nih.gov/) as part of an international celebration for Open Data Day.

At its heart, Open Research Data is about making it easy for you and others to see, use and share data (to find out more, read [this](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/)). This simple idea is powering some of the largest [breakthroughs](https://sparcopen.org/impact-story/human-genome-project/) of our time, and our event aims to celebrate and accelerate the power of Open Research Data.

We invite you, whether new or old to Open Research Data, scholar or citizen, in London or across the globe, to join us for this weekend to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!) in the name of Open Research Data.

In London, we'll provide fast wifi, power (both for your laptops and your bodies) and a program that will spark ideas and collaborations for the weekend.

If you can't make it to London, join us online from wherever you are. We'll be using this GitHub repo for documenting and discussing ideas before, during, and after the event, both for remote participants and everyone else who is interested. As a remote participant, expect to be able to pitch and discuss your ideas for the weekend with all attendees. We'll be using [light orange](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Avirtual%20-label%3Ameta) labels for issues specific to remote attendance, and [light purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Aon-site%20-label%3Ameta) for on-site issues. Note that people in the room are welcome to use the online features as well.

Check out the [yellow labels](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aidea%20-label%3Ameta) for hacky ideas to work on! Feel free to propose your own, even multiple ones: having more ideas may make it easier to find people to team up with. Conversely, feel free to have a go at any of these ideas, and let us &mdash; and their proposers &mdash; know how far you've come. There are [purple](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainterests%20-label%3Ameta) labels for attendees to say what their interests and skills are, which is especially useful if they are not yet involved with one of the proposed ideas.

To present the ideas and to inform about other topics of interest, we'll be having lightning talks, which can be tracked via the [red](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Alightning-talks%20-label%3Ameta) labels.

There are also [light green](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ameta) labels that we're using to organize the event. Your participation is welcome here too.

12-1 pm: Lunch

1-6pm: Working with occasional [lightning talks](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/labels/lightning-talks)

## Day two

# Ideas for the Weekend

We're organizing ideas via this repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aidea%20-label%3Ameta). It's up for you to decide how you spend the weekend, but if you're short on ideas, here are some of ours:
* Trying to find / reuse an open data set
* Building engaging (and open) visualizations of open research data
* Adding some field-specific examples to Data Carpentry lessons
* Building a software library (Python module/ R package/ Ruby gem etc.) to facilitate access to and processing of open data from specific sources
* Building a set of Wikidata SPARQL queries for a specific field
* Harvesting data from the supplementary files of scholarly publications
* Participating in research-related activities that others are planning for Open Data Day
* A data-centric walk around the neighbourhood
* Improving documentation for any of the above
* Adding a “research data” section to the [Open Data Handbook](http://opendatahandbook.org/)
* Improving Wikipedia pages around or with open research data
* Writing data management plans
* Writing data-centric grant proposals
* Make your own data FAIR
* Test out reproducible computational tools such as [Binder](http://mybinder.org/), [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) [we can supply a list of resources]
* Prototype a tool to leverage the open datasets in eLife or in repositories ([Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), [Dataverse](http://dataverse.org/), etc)
* Prototype a tool to make it easy for researchers to share/discover/consume comprehensive, open and FAIR data
* Devise a mechanism to incentivise deposition, review and reuse of datasets
